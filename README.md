# xrm-ci-framework
xRM CI Framework provides you with the tools to automate the build and deployment of your CRM Solution. Using the framework to implement a fully automated DevOps pipeline will allow you to deploy more frequently with added consistency and quality.

The framework contains CRM PowerShell Cmdlets and Sample Scripts that you can use with Build and/or Release Automation Tools (VSTS, Jenkins, Team City, etc...). The Framework now also contains Build & Release tasks that you can install into your Visual Studio Team System.

Take a look at the [Wiki pages](https://github.com/WaelHamze/xrm-ci-framework/wiki) for more information.
